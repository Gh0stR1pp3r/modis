## About Modis

Modis is a Discord bot that runs with a GUI and is designed to be as modular as possible
so that anyone with some basic Python knowledge can quickly and easily create new modules that run on the bot.

## Current Modules

There are currently 9 modules:

- `bethebot`
- `gamedeals`
- `help`
- `hex`
- `manager`
- `music`
- `replies`
- `rocketleague`

### bethebot

bethebot let's the bot's owner send messages as Modis.

### gamedeals

### help

### hex

hex looks for hex values in your messages, and displays a solid block image if it finds a value. hex works with any 3 or 6 digit hex values starting with '#' or '0x'.

### manager

manager allows users to activate and deactivate modules within a server, and change the server prefix for Modis.

### music
